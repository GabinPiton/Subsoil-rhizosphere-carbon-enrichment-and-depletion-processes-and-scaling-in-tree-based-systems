This repository contains all data used in the study "Subsoil rhizosphere carbon enrichment and depletion processes and scaling in tree-based systems" (submitted)


Soil, root and microbial (enzyme activities, qPCR, Phylum and guild relative abundances) data are available in the file : Mastersheet_RhizoGP.xlsx



DNA metabarcoding bacterial 16S data (OTU,seed sequence,taxonomy and read abundances in samples) : Bacteria_16S_Rarefied_OTU_TABLE.csv

DNA metabarcoding fungal 18S data (OTU,seed sequence,taxonomy and read abundances in samples) : Fungi_18S_Rarefied_OTU_TABLE.csv

Metadata to associate DNA metabarcoding sample id with sample information (Land use, Bloc, Depth, Rhizosphere of bulk soil) are provided in the file : Metadata_metabarcoding_samples.xlsx
